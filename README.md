# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
#### The purpose of this project was to develop two deliverables to show Louise how other campaigns, ones that succeeded, failed, and were canceled, did in raising money for their funding goals. We collected the data the appropriate data to create models to show Louise how campaigns did based on when they were launched and their goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
#### The data we collected on the outcomes based on the launch date supports that most of the successful theaters launch in May and fewer of the successful productions launch in December. On the other hand, the productions that have failed were launched in April to August and another spike in October. For the ones that were canceled, the numbers stay pretty consistent throughout the year.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
#### For the outcomes based on goals, the results for successful and failed productions are inverse of one another. The graph shows 78.19% of productions are successful when their goal is $45,000 to $49,999 where the rest fail. Then from $35,000 to $44,999, 66.67% of productions fail. Lastly, at $25,000 to $29,999, 80% of productions are successful.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
#### The only real challenges that I came across were getting used to the new functions on Excel, but with a little patients and rereading the instruction, I was able to figure it out.

## Results

- Two conclusions based on launch date I found was that successful plays seem to be launch in May then a few more in December and for the failed productions, they seemed to fail in the months April to August. Meaning Louise would do best if she were to launch in May.

- For the outcomes based on goal, Louise should make her goal anywhere from $45,000 to $49,999.

- Some limitations of these dataset are we don't know why the productions succeeded, failed, or were canceled. There could have been plenty of reasons like poor casting or poor writing. In addition, we don't know the rating of the show. It could have broke the bank or the production itself could have not been all it was supposed to be.

- We could have also made a graph to show if the number of backers is important to the production as well so Louise could know if she was good on the number of backers she had or if she needed more.
